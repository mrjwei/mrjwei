### About Me
- I am a **trilingual (Chinese, English and Japanese) designer and developer** currently based in Japan.
- I'm particularly passionate about **creating beautiful & user-friendly web services that help business grow**. 
- Major tools I use for designing include Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator and Figma. My favorite tools for coding and deploying include Typescript, Reactjs and Nextjs.
- When I'm not working on my apps, you would find me illustrating or practising latte art. I'm also crazy about the Premier League.

### What I'm doing
