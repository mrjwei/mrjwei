## Hi, I'm Jesse :wave:

I’m a product designer and self-taught software engineer, passionate about **the intersection of creativity and technology**. My goal is to blur the lines between design and development—applying design thinking to software engineering while enhancing my design practice with emerging technologies.  

I’m deeply interested in **workflow optimization** and have developed several programs that automate tasks and boost productivity at the companies I’ve worked for. While I may not yet have the experience of a seasoned developer, my coding skills are already creating real impact, and I’m constantly improving.  

My next big goals include,

1. To create functional software but also ensure it’s scalable, maintainable, and adaptable.
2. To challenge existing design practice by leverage emerging technologies like AI, potentially leading to optimized design workflow along the way.

I’m always eager to connect with like-minded designers and software engineers. If you’d like to follow my journey or collaborate, you can find me at the links below:
