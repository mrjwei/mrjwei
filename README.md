## Hi, I'm [Jesse Wei](https://jessewei.jp)

### About Me
- I am a **trilingual (Chinese, English and Japanese) designer and developer** currently based in Japan.
- User is at the core of my creative practice and my experience in both design and programming has helped me bridge the gap between designers and developers in the teams I've worked for.
- Apart from being active in the digital world, I'm also interested in other forms of design, such as graphic design, illustration and furniture design.
