### About Me
- I am a **trilingual (Chinese, English and Japanese) designer and developer** currently based in Japan.
- I'm particularly passionate about **creating beautiful & user-friendly web services that help business grow**. 
- Major tools I use for designing include Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator and Figma. My favorite tools for coding and deploying include Typescript, Reactjs and Nextjs.
- When I'm not working on my apps, you would find me illustrating or practising latte art. I'm also crazy about the Premier League.

### What I'm doing
Iâ€™m currently taking a PM role on a web app development project. This app is designed to help streamline workflows and improve quality of service in social welfare facilities in Japan.

### What I'm learning
The more I use frontend frameworks, the more I feel like to get down to the basics and get a deeper understanding of the work of Internet, TCP/IP, web APIs and javascript. And these are what I'm studying pretty hard recently.
