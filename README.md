## Hi, I'm Jesse :wave:

I’m a product designer and self-taught software engineer, passionate about **the intersection of creativity and technology**. My goal is to blur the lines between design and development—applying design thinking to software engineering while enhancing my design practice with coding skills.  

I’m deeply interested in **workflow optimization** and have developed several programs that automate tasks and boost productivity at the companies I’ve worked for. While I may not yet have the experience of a seasoned developer, my coding skills are already creating real impact, and I’m constantly improving.  

My next big goal is to not only create functional software but also ensure it’s scalable, maintainable, and adaptable. That’s why I dedicate hours every day to learning about software architecture and object-oriented programming. Recently, I’ve been particularly fascinated by **AI-powered tools**. In fact, I developed a Python GUI app to help me prepare for the IELTS speaking test, and thanks to it, I scored 7.0—my best result in an area I once felt less confident about.  

I’m always eager to connect with like-minded designers and software engineers. If you’d like to follow my journey or collaborate, you can find me at the links below:
